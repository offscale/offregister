Roadmap
=======

  - Put recipes and aux-recipes into many different repositories, with package-management approach:
      0. Find (locally) ubuntu+mesos.
      1. If not found locally, search repo location and install if found (else error).
      2. Import from library
      3. [then existing flow]
  - Show examples with other popular systems, like: Puppet, Salt, Chef and Ansible
  - Prepare more recipes
